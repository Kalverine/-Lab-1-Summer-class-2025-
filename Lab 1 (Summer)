  <h1>Khalid Aras - My first web page</h1>

  <p> Hello! My name is Khalid Aras. I am learning how to make websites using HTML. I actually have done this before but it has been a minute so I can't wait to do it again.</p>

<p> I am looking forward to gain some new skills out of this course.</p>

<ul>
<li> Playing video games</li>
<li> Listen to music</li>
<li> Workout at the gym</li>
<li> Spend some time with my family and friends</li>
<li> Watch some TV</li>
</ul>
